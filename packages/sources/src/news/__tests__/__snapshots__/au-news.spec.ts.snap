We are still seeing significant numbers of returned travellers with the virus developing an infection and, in many cases, passing it on to their families.”</p><p>It’s critical to “stop the capacity” for any returning travellers to spread coronavirus, Professor Murphy.</p><p>“We would look after them when they get the virus, as some will do, as they continue to come home, coming from countries now that have large outbreaks, so the risk is getting higher and higher as the number of flights reduce, but the risk in those countries increase.</p><p>“ This is a really important thing. But we are also worried about community transmission. That is the single most important concern for the health experts.”<br></p></div>"`;
